# Instincts

Persistent engineering patterns observed during work. Lighter than skills — observations with context that accumulate confidence through validation.

## Format

```markdown
### [title]
- **Observed**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Times seen**: [N]
- **Confidence**: low | medium | high
- **Context**: [where/when this was observed]
- **Pattern**: [what happens]
- **Action**: [what to do about it]
- **Status**: active | promoted | retired
```

## Lifecycle

1. **Capture**: Any agent or human records a pattern here via `/instinct`
2. **Validate**: Scout reviews post-swarm, bumps count, adjusts confidence
3. **Promote**: At `high` confidence (3+ validations), scout proposes a new skill draft. Human approves.
4. **Retire**: If proven wrong or irrelevant, scout marks `retired`
